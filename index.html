<h1 style="color:red"> History of COVID-19 </h1>
<p> The first case of COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China. As of 25 May 2020, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare(MoHFW) have confirmed a total of  138,854 cases, 57,721 recoveries and 4,021 deaths in the country. India currently has the fourth largest number of confirmed cases in Asiawith number of cases breaching the 1,00,000 mark on 19 May 2020. India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 3.09% against the global 6.63% as of 20 May 2020. Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Pune, Kolkata and Ahmedabad account for around half of all reported cases in the country. As of 24 May 2020, Lakshwadeep is the only region with 0 cases.

<h2 style="color:blue"> Symptoms of COVID-19 </h2>
<p1 style="color:green">
Serious symptoms:
<ul style="color:orange">
<li>Difficulty in breathing</li> 
<li>Chest pain or pressure</li> 
<li>Loss of speech or movement</li>
</ul>
</p1>
<p2 style="color:lime"> Most common symptoms:
<ul style="color:cyan">
<li>Fever</li> 
<li>Dry cough</li> 
<li>Tiredness</li>
</ul>
</p2>
<p3 style="color:red">Less common symptoms:
<ul style="color:yellow">
<li>Aches and Pains</li> 
<li>Sore throat</li> 
<li>Headache</li>
</ul>
</p3>
<h3 style="color:blue">Diagnosis of COVID-19</h3>
<p4 style="color:lime">In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic and shortages of  laboratory-based molecular testing capacity and reagents, multiple diagnostic test manfacturers have developed and begun seliing rapid and easy-to-use devices to facilitate testing outside of laboratory settings. These simple test kits are based either on detections of proteins from the virus is respiratory samples or detection in blood or serum of human antibodies generated in response to infection.
</p4>
<br>
<br>
<p5 style="color:turquoise">
Two types of diagnostic tests are there:
<ol style="color:pink">
<li> Rapid diagnostic tests based on antigen detection:</li>
<br>
One type of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detects the presence of viral protiens expressed by the virus in sample from the respiratory tract of a person. If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in sample, it will bind to specific antibodies fixed to a paper strip enclosed in plastic casing and generate a visually detectable signal, typically within 30 minutes. The antigen(s) detected are expressed only when the virus is actively replicating. Therefore, such tests are best used to identify acute or early infection.
<br><br>
<li>Rapid diagnostic tests based on host antibody detection:</li>
<br>
This is another, more common type of rapid diagnostic test marketed for COVID-19; a test that detects the presence of antibodies in blood of people believed to have been infected with virus. Antibodies are produced over days to weeks after infection with the virus. The strength of antibody response depends on several factors including age, nutritional status, severity of disease and certain medications or infections like HIV tah supress the imune system. In some people with COVID-19, disease confirmed by molecular testing, weak, late or absent antibody responses have been reported.

<h4 style="color:blue">Preventive measures of COVID-19</h4>
<p6 style="color:green">
Following are preventive measures of COVID-19:
<ul style="color:yellow">
<li>Regularly and thoroughly wash your hands with soap or alcohol-based hand sentizer.</li>
<li>Maintain at least 1 meter distance between you and others.</li>
<li>Avoid going to crowded places.</li>
<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth simultaneously.</li>
<li>Make sure you and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouse and nose with bent elbow or tissue when youcough or sneeze, then dispose the tissue immediately and wash your hands.</li>
<li>Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies, if you need to leave your house wear a mask to avoid infecting others.</li>
<li>Keep up to date on the latest informationfrom trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities.</li>
</ul>

<h5 style="color:cyan">Research initiatives to cure COVID-19</h5>
<p9 style="color:pink">
There are various researchers doing various researches on the vaccine of COVID-19 but WHO and their partners have started an inetrnational trial named "SOLIDARITY" its a clinical trial which will compare three treatment options against standard of care, to access their relative effectiveness against COVID-19. By enrolling patients in multiple countries, the Solidarity trialaims to rapidly discover whether any of the drugsslow disease progression or improve survival. Other drugs can be added based on emerging evidence. Until there is sufficient evidence, WHO cautions against physicians and medical associations recommending or administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 or people self-medicating with them. WHO is concerned by reports of individuals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm.
